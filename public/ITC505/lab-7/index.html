        <p>
          During the implementation of this Mad Lib project, I encountered the
          following challenges and resolved them as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Handling Form Data on the Server Side:</strong> At first, I
            was able to receive the form data with some complications in the
            storage and handling of the values. I fixed this by ensuring that I
            used <code>express.urlencoded({ extended: true })</code>, form data
            that is received is then passed.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Route Conflict with Static Files:</strong> Static files also
            posed a problem together with defining custom routes in my
            server.js. I was able to rectify this by making sure that the static
            file routes were created before the custome routes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Preventing Empty Form Submissions:</strong> At first, I
            failed to handle blank forms correctly, which led to half-filled Mad
            Libs. I incorporated the form validation in the back end side in a
            way that none of the fields are left empty when the output is
            generated.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Displaying Mad Lib Output Correctly:</strong> The issue was
            with string concatenation and as a result the output was coming out
            all mixed up. This I was able to solve by using string interpolation
            and also ensuring good HTML planning in terms of structure.
          </li>

    <footer>
      <p>Last updated: <span id="lastModified"></span></p>
    </footer>
    <script type="text/javascript">
      var x = document.lastModified;
      document.getElementById("lastModified").textContent = x;
    </script>
